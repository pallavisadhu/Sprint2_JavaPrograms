Advertising aims to put a product or service in the spotlight in hopes of drawing it attention from consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are wide range of uses, the most common being the commercial advertisement. Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "[[Branding (promotional)|branding]]", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. In the 19th century, [[soap]] businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. [[Thomas J. Barratt]] was hired by [[Pears (soap)|Pears]] to be its brand manager\'97the first of its kind\'97and in addition to creating slogans and images he recruited West End stage actress and socialite [[Lillie Langtry]] to become the poster-girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.<ref name=\'93Endorse\'94/> Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with [[tobacco advertising]] in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of [[Edward Bernays]], considered the founder of modern, "[[Madison Avenue]]" advertising.<ref name="Studlar2002p55">Donley T.

Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts.

These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the printing press; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after. However, [[false advertising]] and so-called "[[Quackery|quack]]" advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content. === 19th century === [[Image:Pears Soap 1900.jpg|thumb|Poster for [[Pears (soap)|Pears soap]] created under [[Thomas J.

He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them.

Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad \'96 the copy, layout, and artwork \'96 was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed when the first full-service advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded in 1869 in Philadelphia. Ayer & Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession. <ref name="eskilson-pg58">\{\{Cite book |title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-300-12011-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/graphicdesignnew00eski/page/58 58] |url=https://archive.org/details/graphicdesignnew00eski/page/58 \}\}</ref> Around the same time, in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

Airtime is purchased from a station or network in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found on air, and also online.

Online ads are delivered by an ad server. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, in [[pay per click]] text ads, [[rich media]] ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]].<ref>\{\{Cite book|last1=Semer\'e1dov\'e1|first1=Tereza|url=|title=Impacts of Online Advertising on Business Performance|last2=Weinlich|first2=Petr|date=2019-10-23|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-7998-1618-8|language=en\}\}</ref> A newer form of online advertising is [[Native advertising|Native Ads]]; they go in a website's news feed and are supposed to improve user experience by being less intrusive.

When an Internet user visits a website by typing a domain name directly into their web browser, this is known as "direct navigation", or "type in" web traffic. Although many Internet users search for ideas and products using search engines and mobile phones, a large number of users around the world still use the address bar. They will type a keyword into the address bar such as "geraniums" and add ".com" to the end of it. Sometimes they will do the same with ".org" or a country-code Top Level Domain (TLD such as ".co.uk" for the United Kingdom or ".ca" for Canada).

For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them "classics", because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In "[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]", the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.\{\{citation needed|date=December 2014\}\} ;Print: Print advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. One form of print advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad paid by the word or line. Another form of print advertising is the display ad, which is generally a larger ad with design elements that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.<ref name="Bovee" />\{\{rp|14\}\} ;Outdoor: [[File:London , Piccadilly Circus looking up Shaftsbury Ave , circa 1949 ,Kodachrome by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|250px|Outdoor advertisements, such as [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], London \{\{Circa|1949\}\} pictured here, are usually placed in busy locations.]] [[Billboard]]s, also known as hoardings in some parts of the world, are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large numbers of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums. The form known as street advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements.

These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: target advertising, one-day and long-term campaigns, conventions, sporting events, store openings and similar promotional events, and big advertisements from smaller companies.<ref name=":0" /> [[File:Redeye Sailboat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[RedEye]]'' newspaper advertised to its target market at [[North Avenue Beach]] with a sailboat billboard on [[Lake Michigan]].]] ;Point-of-sale: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store.

Some printers specialize in printing novelty items, which can then be distributed directly by the advertiser, or items may be distributed as part of a cross-promotion, such as ads on fast food containers. \{\{citation needed| date= January 2017\}\} ;Celebrity endorsements: Advertising in which a celebrity endorses a product or brand leverages celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products or to promote specific stores' or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however; one mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the [[public relations]] of a brand.

Different colours play major roles when it comes to marketing strategies, for example, seeing the blue can promote a sense of calmness and gives a sense of security which is why many social networks such as Facebook use blue in their logos. [[Google AdSense]] is an example of niche marketing. Google calculates the primary purpose of a website and adjusts ads accordingly; it uses keywords on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account or website visitors. === Crowdsourcing === \{\{Main|Crowdsourcing\}\} The concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by people, as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, often resulting from brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the "Crash the Super Bowl" contest, allowing people to create their own [[Doritos]] commercials.<ref name="Advertising Age">\{\{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007 |publisher=Advertising Age |access-date=May 10, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218070122/http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |archive-date=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all \}\}</ref> [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.<ref name="Advertising Age" /> Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the "most buzzed-about".<ref>\{\{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |access-date=May 10, 2010 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217050431/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |archive-date=February 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all \}\}</ref><ref>\{\{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |newspaper=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2010 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227030845/http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |archive-date=December 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all \}\}</ref> Another example of companies using crowdsourcing successfully is the beverage company [[Jones Soda]] that encourages consumers to participate in the label design themselves.<ref>\{\{cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/digitalnext/crowdsourcing/132873/ |title=Crowdsourcing: Everything Old Is New Again, and Again |website=adage.com |date=2008-11-26 |access-date=2019-03-04\}\}</ref> This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company.

For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing [[economies of scale]] in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.<ref>Global marketing Management, 2004, pp. 13\'968</ref> Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how [[economies of scale]] are maximized. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.<ref>Young, p.131</ref> === Foreign public messaging === \{\{See also|Soft power|International tourism advertising\}\} Foreign governments,\{\{which|date=December 2014\}\} particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]]. Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] (Singapore), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] (People's Republic of China). By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions. === Diversification === In the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that "big global clients don't need big global agencies any more".<ref>\{\{cite web |last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=October 10, 2005 |access-date=April 20, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327010633/http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |archive-date=March 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all \}\}</ref> This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as "a revolution in the ad world".<ref>\{\{cite magazine |url = https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm |title = Madison Ave. Lights Up |first = Devin |last = Leonard |magazine = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date = December 12, 2005 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210859/https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/12/8363132/index.htm |archive-date = June 6, 2009 |df = mdy-all \}\}</ref> === New technology === [[File:Facebook advertising.jpg|thumb|Human billboard at the [[National Multicultural Festival]] being used to advertise Facebook news feed]] The ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from these sets. To counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected [[EPG|program guides]]s (EPGs), advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating [[mobile apps]] for TV programs. Additionally, some like brands have opted for [[social television]] sponsorship.<ref>\{\{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|title=Reality TV|website=realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419064602/http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|archive-date=April 19, 2015|df=mdy-all\}\}</ref> The emerging technology of [[drone display]]s has recently been used for advertising purposes.<ref>\{\{cite web| url = https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/11/intel-launches-500-drones-into-sky-and-breaks-world-record-in-spectacular-style-449886| title = Intel launches 500 drones into sky and breaks world record in spectacular style| date = November 4, 2016\}\}</ref> === Education === In recent years there have been several media literacy initiatives, and more specifically concerning advertising, that seek to empower citizens in the face of media advertising campaigns.<ref>\{\{Cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Britt|last2=Schellens|first2=Tammy|last3=Valcke|first3=Martin|date=2017|title=Promoting Adolescents' Moral Advertising Literacy in Secondary Education|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=93\'96103|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-09|issn=1134-3478|doi-access=free\}\}</ref> [[Advertising education]] has become popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis.\{\{citation needed|date=December 2014\}\} A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking.\{\{citation needed|date=December 2014\}\} A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.<ref>\{\{Cite book |url = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED351711&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED351711 |title = Student-Run Advertising Agency: A Showcase for Student Work. |first = James |last = Avery |date = 1992-08-01 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090724163231/http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true |archive-date = July 24, 2009 |df = mdy-all \}\}</ref> Organizations such as the [[American Advertising Federation]] establish companies with students to create these campaigns.\{\{citation needed|date=December 2014\}\} == Purposes == Advertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and prospective customers. The purpose of advertising is to inform the consumers about their product and convince customers that a company's services or products are the best, enhance the image of the company, point out and create a need for products or services, demonstrate new uses for established products, announce new products and programs, reinforce the salespeople's individual messages, draw customers to the business, and to hold existing customers.<ref>\{\{cite book|title = How to start and succeed in a business of your own |first=John| last=Taylor| year = 1978| page=293\}\}</ref> === Sales promotions and brand loyalty === Sales promotions are another way to advertise. Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers one draws in and where they are, and to jump start sales. Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts. The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action.<ref>Altstiel, Tom, and Jean Grow. Advertising Strategy: Creative Tactics From the Outside/In.

It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns. Pre-testing includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques, including: focus groups, in-depth target audience interviews (one-on-one interviews), small-scale quantitative studies and physiological measurement. The goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts, thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals.<ref>\{\{Cite web|url=http://www.copytesting.org|title=CopyTesting.org|website=www.copytesting.org|access-date=2017-02-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425021551/http://copytesting.org/|archive-date=April 25, 2017|df=mdy-all\}\}</ref> Post-testing employs many of the same techniques as pre-testing, usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement. With the emergence of digital advertising technologies, many firms have begun to continuously post-test ads using real-time data. This may take the form of A/B split-testing or multivariate testing. Continuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.<ref>Peeter Verlegh, Hilde Voorveld, and Martin Eisend, eds.

Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print advertisements, and [[television advertisements]]. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels \'96 known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product.\{\{citation needed|date=April 2015\}\} These signs can be images, words, fonts, [[color]]s, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, [[color]]s, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.<ref>\{\{cite book|last= Beasley|first= Ron|title= Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year= 2002|publisher= Walter deGruyter GmbH & KG|location= Berlin, Germany|isbn= 978-3-11-017341-3\}\}</ref> The "key to advertising analysis" is the signifier and the signified.

The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product. A television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition. The connotative meaning is the product's deep and hidden meaning. A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line.<ref>\{\{cite book|last= Umiker-Sebeok|first= Donna Jean|title= Marketing and Semiotics|year= 1987|publisher= Walter de Gruyter & Co.|location= Berlin\}\}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] commercials\{\{when|date=April 2015\}\} used a black [[silhouette]] of a person that was the age of Apple's target market. They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones. Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod. The white color signifies almost all of Apple's products.<ref>\{\{cite web|last= Salsburey|first= Justin|title= Semiotic analysis of iPod Advertisements|url= http://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130521105135/https://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|archive-date= May 21, 2013|df= mdy-all\}\}</ref> The semiotics of [[gender]] plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering [[Gender advertisement|gender roles in advertising]], individuals are influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the message ([[tradition]]al or non-traditional [[gender role]] orientation). Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message.\{\{citation needed|date=August 2021\}\} There are two types of [[marketing communication]] claims-objective and subjective.<ref>\{\{cite journal|last= Koc|first= Erdogan|title= Impact of gender in marketing communications: the role of cognitive and affective cues|journal= Journal of Marketing Communications|year= 2002|volume= 8|issue= 4|page= 257|doi= 10.1080/13527260210145993|s2cid= 167941776\}\}</ref> Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature.

Later research by a Danish team<ref>Vestergaard and Schr\'f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'', 75</ref> found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women aims at [[metamorphosis|transformation]] toward an impossible ideal of female presentation. In Paul Suggett's article "The Objectification of Women in Advertising" he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements, who are too perfect to be real, have on women, as well as men, in real life.<ref>\{\{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-05-07|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326082225/https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|archive-date=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all\}\}</ref> Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, within music videos and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively affect their views about their bodies and appearances. These advertisements are directed towards men. Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized.<ref>Splendora, "Discourse", Review of Vestergaard and Schr\'f8der, ''The Language of Advertising'' in ''Language in Society,'' 449</ref>\{\{qn|date=February 2017\}\} There are some companies like [[Dove Beauties|Dove]] and [[Aerie (clothing retailer)|aerie]]<!--- no caps as stylized ---> that are creating commercials to portray more natural women, with less [[image manipulation|post production manipulation]], so more women and young girls are able to relate to them.\{\{citation needed|date=August 2018\}\} More recent research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads and on the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewer's mood state.<ref> Martin, Brett A. S.
